# How to Convert a Word Document to an RTF File Using the .NET Word Library

This repository provides an example of how to convert a Word document to RTF, and an RTF file to a Word document using the **Syncfusion .NET Word Library (DocIO)**. 

## Process Behind Word–RTF Conversion

This sample shows how easily you can switch between Word (.docx) and Rich Text Format (.rtf) using the Syncfusion DocIO library. These conversions are useful when you need to:

- Share documents in a lightweight, widely supported RTF format.
- Preserve text formatting while avoiding the full complexity of a DOCX file.
- Integrate RTF files into applications that require plain rich-text formatting.

Using the Syncfusion DocIO library, you can:

- Convert a Word document (.docx) to an RTF file (.rtf).
- Convert an RTF file (.rtf) back to a Word document (.docx).

## Steps to use the sample

1. Open the ASP.NET Core application where the Syncfusion DocIO package is installed.
2. Run the application and click the following buttons:
   - **Word to RTF**: Converts an existing Word document to an RTF file.
   - **RTF to Word**: Converts an existing RTF file back to a Word document.
