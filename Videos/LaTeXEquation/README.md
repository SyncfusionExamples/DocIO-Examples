# How to Work with Latex Equations in a Word Document Using the .NET Word Library

This repository provides an example of how to work with LaTeX equations in a Word document using the **Syncfusion .NET Word Library (DocIO)**. It demonstrates how to create, add, and edit LaTeX equations in Word documents.

## Process behind Field Integration

This sample shows how LaTeX syntax can be used to insert professional mathematical equations into Word documents. LaTeX is widely used in scientific and academic fields for typesetting complex formulas.

Using the Syncfusion DocIO library, you can:

- Create equations like area of a circle, quadratic formula, and Fourier series in a new Word document.
- Add equations dynamically to an existing document at specific locations.
- Edit equations by modifying LaTeX strings to update variables.

## Steps to use the sample

1. Open the ASP.NET Core application where the Syncfusion DocIO package is installed.
2. Run the application and click the following buttons:
   - **CreateEquation**: Creates a Word document with multiple LaTeX equations.
   - **AddEquation**: Inserts a new LaTeX equation into an existing document
   - **EditEquation**: Updates an existing LaTeX equation in the document.
